### AIM
<b>Perform an extensive search to find a detailed guide on building a handwritten digit classification model using the 'Hello World' program for the MNIST dataset. Afterward, develop an equally rigorous tutorial for one of the TMNIST datasets.</b>

1. Outperformed with 95% image identification accuracy using CNN+LSTM, and ResNet+GRU models for image captioning.
2. Fine-tuned pre-trained networks and optimized hyperparameters for improved performance.
3. Surpassed baseline model with BLEU-4 scores of 0.67 (CNN+LSTM) and 0.71 (ResNet+GRU).
4. Demonstrated the power of deep learning in combining computer vision and natural language processing.
